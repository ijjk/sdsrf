<p class='notice'>Due to varying state laws, SDS Research Fund is currently soliciting donations from residents of the following states: AZ, CO, DE, IA, ID, IN, KS, LA, MO, MT, NE, OK, SD, TX, VT, and WY. If you are a resident outside of these states, please contact us for how you can support the mission of SDS Research Fund.</p>

<p class='note'><h5>DID YOU KNOW</h5> that nonprofits have a responsibility and a legal obligation to use donations for the purpose in which the donation was solicited? For example, when an organization requests donations for research, donations made in response to that solicitation must be restricted for that purpose. You can trust that when SDS Research Fund makes an appeal for your hard earned dollars, we are committed to honoring the designation in which your donation was solicited. SDS Research Fund Board of Directions is dedicated to fulfilling the ethical responsibility of receiving charitable contributions and is committed to honoring the designation wishes of its donors. Designate your contribution to the cause today!</p>
