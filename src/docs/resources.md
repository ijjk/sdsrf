##### Bone Marrow Registry Drives
Families of individuals with SDS often wonder how they can host a bone marrow registry drive. These registries are important because individuals with SDS may need a bone marrow transplant as a life-saving measure when they begin to show signs of progression into aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia. Anyone can host a bone marrow registry drive! From parents of individuals with SDS to friends and extended family, the first step to scheduling your drive is to contact a donor registry to get started. SDS Research Fund would be happy to assist you in making this contact.

- [Be The Match](https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/participate/host-a-donor-drive/) - the largest and most diverse donor registry in the world, Be the Match is the connection between patients searching for a cure and life-saving bone marrow donors

- [DKMS](https://www.dkms.org/en) - working with families and communities to recruit bone marrow donors and provide patients with second chances at life, DKMS is a leader in the fight against blood cancer
